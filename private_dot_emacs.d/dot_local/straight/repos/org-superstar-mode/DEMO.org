#+TITLE:Demo Reel

Here I present a couple of screen shots for a variety of simple
configurations (source included).  Regarding the primary fonts used, I
picked:
 * *DejaVu Sans Mono* for graphical sessions
 * *Liberation Mono* for terminal sessions.

The file used for all demos can be found in ~tests/sample.org~.

* Vanilla

This is the current default experience you get when using vanilla
Emacs (~emacs -q~) and only do the absolute minimum to set up Superstar
automatically.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
              (lambda ()
                (org-superstar-mode 1)))
  #+END_SRC

* LaTeX-style headings
  As the title suggests, this setup provides a quick alternative to
  the Emacs-typical [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AngryFruitSalad][angry fruit salad look]], replacing it with a more
  in-print style.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;;; Titles and Sections
    ;; hide #+TITLE:
    (setq org-hidden-keywords '(title))
    ;; set basic title font
    (set-face-attribute 'org-level-8 nil :weight 'bold :inherit 'default)
    ;; Low levels are unimportant => no scaling
    (set-face-attribute 'org-level-7 nil :inherit 'org-level-8)
    (set-face-attribute 'org-level-6 nil :inherit 'org-level-8)
    (set-face-attribute 'org-level-5 nil :inherit 'org-level-8)
    (set-face-attribute 'org-level-4 nil :inherit 'org-level-8)
    ;; Top ones get scaled the same as in LaTeX (\large, \Large, \LARGE)
    (set-face-attribute 'org-level-3 nil :inherit 'org-level-8 :height 1.2) ;\large
    (set-face-attribute 'org-level-2 nil :inherit 'org-level-8 :height 1.44) ;\Large
    (set-face-attribute 'org-level-1 nil :inherit 'org-level-8 :height 1.728) ;\LARGE
    ;; Only use the first 4 styles and do not cycle.
    (setq org-cycle-level-faces nil)
    (setq org-n-level-faces 4)
    ;; Document Title, (\huge)
    (set-face-attribute 'org-document-title nil
                        :height 2.074
                        :foreground 'unspecified
                        :inherit 'org-level-8)

    ;;; Basic Setup
    ;; Auto-start Superstar with Org
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
              (lambda ()
                (org-superstar-mode 1)))

* Customized Bullets and Terminal Fallback
  This time we want all of the above but a little more personalized.
  First off, let's make bullets a little more chunky.  Mind that the
  height we provide for bullet faces is not the /actual/ height of a
  bullet, but its height /relative to its surroundings/.  Additionally,
  let's hide the leading stars for terminal sessions, as the default
  leader does not look all that good in my chosen terminal font.  I
  make use of the fact that ~org-superstar-leading-fallback~ can be set
  to the space character.  This has the nice advantage over
  ~org-hide-leading-stars~ that it does not just "paint over" the
  asterisks, but makes them completely indistinguishable from white
  space, neat!

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (with-eval-after-load 'org-superstar
      (set-face-attribute 'org-superstar-item nil :height 1.2)
      (set-face-attribute 'org-superstar-header-bullet nil :height 1.2)
      (set-face-attribute 'org-superstar-leading nil :height 1.3))
    ;; Set different bullets, with one getting a terminal fallback.
    (setq org-superstar-headline-bullets-list
          '("â—‰" ("ðŸž›" ?â—ˆ) "â—‹" "â–·"))
    ;; Stop cycling bullets to emphasize hierarchy of headlines.
    (setq org-superstar-cycle-headline-bullets nil)
    ;; Hide away leading stars on terminal.
    (setq org-superstar-leading-fallback ?\s)

* Org Inline Tasks
  Inline tasks behave as you would expect them to, for the most part.
  They have two bullets instead of one, but are otherwise treated the
  same as regular headlines by Org Superstar, meaning
  ~org-superstar-headline-bullets-list~ controls the bullet used as if
  it were a regular headline.  If ~org-inlinetask-show-first-star~ is
  non-nil, you can customize the additional marker.  Just like with
  the rest of Superstar's decorations, you can more or less fully
  control how it looks, with independent settings for graphical and
  terminal displays and a dedicated face, should you find the default
  of using ~org-warn~ a little\dots unsubtle.  We again use the LaTeX setup
  as a base and add a few tweaks.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-inlinetask)
  (setq org-inlinetask-show-first-star t)
  ;; Less gray please.
  (set-face-attribute 'org-inlinetask nil
                      :foreground nil
		      :inherit 'bold)
  (with-eval-after-load 'org-superstar
    (set-face-attribute 'org-superstar-first nil
                        :foreground "#9000e1"))
  ;; Set different bullets, with one getting a terminal fallback.
  (setq org-superstar-headline-bullets-list
        '("â—‰" ("ðŸž›" ?â—ˆ) "â—‹" "â–·"))
  ;; Set up a different marker for graphic display.
  (setq org-superstar-first-inlinetask-bullet ?ðŸž¸)
  ;; Stop cycling bullets to emphasize hierarchy of headlines.
  (setq org-superstar-cycle-headline-bullets nil)
  ;; A simple period works fine, too.
  (setq org-superstar-leading-fallback ?.)
