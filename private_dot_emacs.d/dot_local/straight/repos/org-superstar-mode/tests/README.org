#+TITLE: Testing Routines: There be Dragons

* Purpose
This is where I will put cleaned up testing routines meant for testing
and debugging ~org-superstar-mode~.  However, as the title suggests,
*none of these files are meant for normal package usage*.  Consequently,
I advise to run these files with a minimal setup (think =emacs -Q=).  To
further emphasize that I do not intend to ship any of these functions
as part of my package, I use the non-standard (yet popular) naming
convention ~org-superstar/variable-name~.  See below for the purpose of
the individual files included here.

** =sample.org=
A harmless sample file.  An earlier version was used for the sample
image in the top-level README.

** =sample-todo.org=
   Another sample file, this time to test TODO keywords.
** =minimal-setup.el=
This file contains a minimal setup useful for testing.  Just run:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
emacs -Q -l ../org-superstar.el -l minimal-setup.el sample.org
#+END_SRC

To run additional test files, it is easiest to just =-l= them as well.

** =composure-test.el=
This file adds lots of information regarding calls to ~compose-region~
for functions defined in =org-superstar.el=.  They are written to the
=*Messages*= buffer.  It also makes sure all ~--prettify-~ functions
return proper faces (or ~nil~).  This module auto-enables
~column-number-mode~ as well as ~linum-mode~ for org to allow for manual,
character-wise comparison of the characters prettified.

** =face-test.el=
This file sets all faces to strongly contrasting colors and adds many
different face properties to see if and how they work.  It essentially
serves as a test image for quick visual confirmation that all faces
are applied consistently.

** =font-lock-test.el=
A proper [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/index.html][ERT]]-based testing module for testing basic fontification
using [[https://github.com/Lindydancer/faceup][the ~faceup~ package]].  Simply run either ~make font-lock~ or ~make
font-lock-inlinetask~ to test whether ~org-superstar-mode~ applies the
correct faces.

*Note:* Due to the flexibility of Org, I advise against running this
test in a live Emacs session, as false positives may occur from
unexpected customization.
