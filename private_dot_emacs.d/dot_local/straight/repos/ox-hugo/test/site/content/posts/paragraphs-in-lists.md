-   Bullet lists can have paragraphs or block elements within them.

    Just indent the content to be even with the text of the bullet
    point, rather than the bullet itself.
    ```shell
    ls -l
    ```
-   Here's the second bullet item.

    Paragraph 1 in second bullet.

    Paragraph 2 in second bullet.

Paragraph outside the list.

foo1
: Descriptive list item.

    Paragraph 1 in the desc list item.

    Paragraph 2 in the desc list item.

foo2
: Descriptive list item.

    Paragraph 1 in the desc list item.

    Paragraph 2 in the desc list item.
